Changes:
- Correct guess is now a boolean of TRUE, instead of FALSE
- Limit the number of prizes so that numberOfPrizes is always lower than numberOfOptions
- Created function generatePrizeLocations() that will return prize locations(with no duplicates)
- gameSequence now initialized with Collections.fill()
- Limit all input numbers to be greater than 0
- Check that number of guesses is the same as numberOfRounds
- Check that guess index is between 1 and numberOfOptions
- Created positive test scenarios
- Implemented custom exceptions and integrated them into negative test scenarios
- New Round is instantiated in playGame, before calling playRound()

Found Bugs:
- Bug: gameSequence was initialized with 1 less element (Constructor)
- Bug: for loop should go from 0 to numberOfRounds-1 (PlayGame)
- Bug: For has to go from 0 to numberOfPrizes - 1 (NewRound)
- Bug: possibility of generating same number twice (NewRound)
- Bug: In the testPointIncrease, the number of Prizes was set to be greater than the number of options
    -> This would cause the test to fail

Custom Exceptions:
- ArgumentLessOrEqualToZeroException - When one of the number arguments is less or equal to zero
- IllegalNumberOfPrizesException - When the number of prizes is greater than number of options
- IllegalNumberOfGuessesException - When the number of guesses differs from number of rounds
- IllegalGuessIndexException - When the guess index is greater than number of options or less than zero

Assumptions:
- numberOfPrizes must be between 1 and numberOfOptions(including numberOfOptions)
- list of guesses passed into playGame must be the same size as the numberOfRounds

If this were production level code and the task was given to me, some sort of clarification for these assumptions would have been made.
In this example I made assumptions based on guessing games I have seen in the past.
